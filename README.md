ChatGPT Conversation backup and management solution
Backup, search, edit and organize your ChatGPT conversations with ease.

I built this application to learn Swift and SwiftUI and to see how far vibe coding an app with ChatGPT could go. The main conclusion of this project is that ChatGPT will give you very different code and answers in different occasions. You will find this in the code where sometimes it uses older ways of doing things in SwiftUI. I suppose that is because SwiftUI was a bit of a moving target back in December 2023/January 2024 when this app was created.

The code I created here does not reflect the code I write professionally. There are no tests and there are a lot of shortcuts. After all this was created in a few weeks over Christmas so please give me sone slack.

I havenâ€™t tested building from scratch from this repo yet so please open an issue if anything is missing.

This app is available in the AppStore and you can find information and pictures at https://chat-organizer.com/
